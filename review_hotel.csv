Eventhough its not perfect in anyway but I just love the amount of detail and care put into the theme of monochromatic-elegance hotel.

Mahima Hotel Semarang,Tri Armalia,4.0,"2nd time staying at Mahima due to affordable rates. Place surrounding is not so noisy, but the wall is quite thin, you can hear the sound of kids playing around from outside room. You need to prepare cash since they require 100k deposit and additional charge 50k if you request more pillow for sleeping. This doesnt happen to other hotels i stayed before. Plus point is that the towel is big and comfy"
Mahima Hotel Semarang,andy eko,2.0,"Hotel good. Rooms good. Food taste good. Food variety not good. Breakfast definitely not good, better eat outside. Checkout 12.00. Checkout at 14.00 pay 25%. GM Doli is good. If I'm not mistaken in the room said restaurant closed at 11pm, but at 9pm they already request to pay. GM Doli is good. Security good. Parking good. Housekeeping good. Receptionist and marketing, NOT GOOD! We call said available. 20 minutes before arrive we still communicate said okay, please come to hotel. Already arrive to hotel, still greet us with smile, said check in at 2pm. We said okay. No problem. We said may we see the room, after that we will pay, than the smiling face turn to be pale. And said sorry, the room is not available. Amazing receptionist. There is no effort helping us find another room at other hotels. When we ask to meet the boss, he said he is the boss. Wow we are surprised if he is the boss. So he is the best. And the best only can say sorry. Because traveloka bla bla bla. Hey, we already use traveloka so many years, and there is no problem. Amazing! Finally a bigger boss come, and he help us, for that we say thank you. Mr. Bigger boss you need to improve or do something to you staff, its not good for your hotel. So 2 star i think enough."

Mahima Hotel Semarang,hery sehastian,3.0,"(Translated by Google) Stopped by this hotel 2 weeks ago just for the night just to continue the trip to Jakarta. the location is very close to the toll road. The cleanliness of the room is lacking, you can get a room where the bathroom still has hair marks on the wall and the toilet has traces of people defecating. Until the hotel at night, I want to take a shower and sleep right away but I still have to deal with a toilet like that. (Original) Mampir ke hotel ini 2 minggu lalu cm buat bermalam aja buat lanjut trip ke Jakarta. lokasinya bgs dekat dgn tol. Kebersihan kamarnya kurang, dapat kamar yg kamar mandinya msh ada bekas rambut di dinding dan toiletnya ada bekas orang buang air besar. Sampe hotel ud malam mau lsng mandi dan tdr tapi msh harus berurusan dgn toilet yg seperti itu."
Mahima Hotel Semarang,Veren Sasmita,5.0,"(Translated by Google) quite clean and comfortable, toiletries at that time lacked shampoo, but luckily I brought my own, towels don't smell, but don't smell good either, the water heater goes up and down the water temperature, so sometimes it's too hot, sometimes just right, then it gets cold and keeps getting hot again, even though the faucet is not shifted (Original) cukup bersih dan nyaman, toiletries saat itu kurang shampoo, tapi untung bawa sendiri sih, handuk tidak bau, tapi tidak wangi juga, water heater naik turun suhu airnya, jd kadang terlalu panas, kadang pas, nanti dingin terus panas lagi, padahal kran nya tidak digeser"
Mahima Hotel Semarang,Ardi Santoso,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The hotel is clean, still new and comfortable The location is quite strategic, Lots of plus points: 1. In the morning near the hotel there are those who sell typical Semarang snacks which are rarely found in Jakarta 2. The room is clean, comfortable to rest 3. The parking lot is quite spacious 4. The hotel staff is also friendly and always maintains the cov19 protocol *even though we already consider this to be endemic (Original) Hotelnya bersih, masih baru dan nyaman Lokasi cukup strategis, Banyak bgt poin plusnya : 1. Kalau pagi dekat hotel ada yg berjualan jajanan ciri khas semarang yg jarang bgt ada di jakarta 2. Kamarnya bersih, nyaman untuk istirahat 3. Parkirannya cukup luas 4. Staff hotel juga ramah dan selalu menjaga protokol cov19 *walaupun kami sdh menganggap ini sbg endemic"
Mahima Hotel Semarang,Allen Stevano,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The hotel is okay, still new, breakfast is also good, only the location is quite far from the city center and access to traffic jams against trucks. The hot water is off but still can be a little warm. (Original) Hotelnya Oke masih baru, sarapan juga enak, hanya lokasi cukup jauh dari pusat kota dan akses macet lawan truck2. Air panasnya mati tapi masi bisa sedikit hangat."

Mahima Hotel Semarang,Mas Danu,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The hotel is still new, so it's very clean. The service is very friendly, from the moment you arrive the door is opened by security and greets you in a friendly manner. Greeted by a friendly receptionist too. PSN extra slipper and borrowed scissors by phone, it didn't even take 5 minutes to deliver. The minus: the sink is a bit less absorbing the water, I want to order lunch at 2 pm but the restaurant is only ready at 4 pm. And the location is a bit far from the mini market, so if you need snacks, just order online. The location is a bit far from the iconic places of Semarang: Sampokong, Lawangsewu, Kotalama (about 100 thousand back and forth by car online) (Original) Hotelnya masih baru, jadi bersih banget. Pelayanannya ramah banget, dari sejak Dateng dibukakan pintu sama security dan menyapa dengan ramah. Disambut dengan receptionist yang ramah juga. PSN extra slipper dan pinjem gunting by phone lsg dianter ga sampe 5 menit. Minusnya : wastafel agak kurang lancar nyerap airnya, mau pesan makan siang jam 2 siang tapi resto nya baru ready jam 4 sore.Dan lokasinya agak jauh dari minimarket, jadi kalau butuh cemilan order online aja dech. Lokasinya agak jauh dari tempat iconicnya Semarang :sampokong,lawangsewu,Kotalama (sekitar 100 ribu bolak balik by car online)"

Mahima Hotel Semarang,Mee Muni,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Duh fell in love with this modern minimalist style hotel. I like buildings with lots of glass. Looks cool. It is located on Jl. Raya Hanuman no. 62 Semarang. Its location which is not on the main road makes the atmosphere cool and calm. I chose the one that included breakfast because it was a bit far for food vendors. The hotel is clean and the breakfast is very varied, 2 nights staying here even the menu changes. The waiter was quick and friendly. Good job guys (Original) Duhh jatuh cinta deh dengan hotel bergaya modern minimalis ini. Sukak dengan bangunan yang banyak kacanya. Keliatan ademmm. Letaknya di Jl. Raya Hanoman no. 62 Semarang. Lokasinya yang bukan di jalan utama membuat suasana adem dan tenang. Aku pilih yang include sarapan karena memang untuk penjual makanan agak jauh. Hotelnya bersih dan sarapan nya sangat bervariasi, 2 malam stay disini pun menunya ganti. Pelayannya pun sigap dan ramah. Good job guys"

Mahima Hotel Semarang,Amalia Hayati,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The hotel feels still new, so the sheets and towels still look clean white so you don't have to worry about resting. I suggest bringing your own toiletries because the hotel provides standard ones. Check in and check out fast. Will return again to this hotel when I go to Semarang. (Original) Hotel terasa masih baru, jd seprei selimut handuk msh keliatan putih bersih jd gak khawatir buat istirahat. Sy sarankan bawa kebutuhan mandi sendiri krn hotel menyediakan yg standar. Check in dan check out cepat. Bakal balik lg ke hotel ini klo ke semarang."

Mahima Hotel Semarang,Azahra Arum Nurulchusna,3.0,"(Translated by Google) The hall can be used for weddings, but it's a bit small, maybe not all of those who have jobs are open. So less comfortable for guests. (Original) Hall bisa untuk nikahan tapi rada kecil, mungkin yang punya kerja gak dibuka semua. Jadi kurang nyaman untuk tamu."
Mahima Hotel Semarang,Maryanto Sadiatmoro,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The place is comfortable, clean, good for lobbying/chatting. friendly staff, spacious parking (Original) Tempatnya nyaman,bersih,enak untuk lobi/ngobrol. petugasnya ramah,parkir luas"
Mahima Hotel Semarang,Ffun Family,3.0,"(Translated by Google) The advantages of the hotel we have ever felt: 1. Hotel building: The appearance of the building is good. The first time I saw it, it definitely felt wow.. it was unique and nice.. in my opinion, after staying 2√ó, this hotel is really good, unique, homey. 2. Staff: The staff is friendly, we once asked for help to clean the room because the floor felt really dusty, changed the sheets/blankets, served well and remained friendly. 3. Protocols during the covid 19 pandemic: First stay a few months ago, when we arrived, we were sprayed with disinfectant and checked body temperature. But yesterday it wasn't. in front of the lobby door yesterday there happened to be no staff. Maybe because it's too late. Check-in time, look at the ballpoint pen for the customer in the UV light. 4. Room: The interior design of the room is pretty good, minimalist, once you enter you feel calm. The lights are subdued, so when you enter the room, you feel the ambiance is sleepy. Overall cleanliness is decent. Weaknesses we've experienced: 1. Room: the floor of the room feels dusty, there is no cupboard, only a clothes hanger rack. Sheets/blankets sometimes have stains on them. So ask for a change. 2. Room bathroom: a bit cramped and a little less clean on the floor and rack of amenities. It looks like old. On the floor where there is a toilet seat, there is no water drain hole. So, for example, if you get sprayed by a jet shower in the toilet or when you use the sink, there happens to be water spilled on the floor, the water is swollen on the floor, it can't go down the hole. The shower area is okay. The shower has a shower planted above, plus a faucet. At that time, how come there was no mat + towel? So ask the officer and then give it. The hot water at that time didn't work. Then told the receptionist, it finally turned on. 3. There were no mats and towels at that time, ask first. 4. Breakfast: The place to eat breakfast is on the lobby floor, a cafe table which is also open to the public. The menu has quite a variety, not much, just when we wanted to eat, it turned out that all the menus were cold, not warm at all. Even though underneath there is a food warmer using spiritus. But the condition is off. So after taking the food, I asked the staff to warm the food using the microwave. All the food was open, and there were some flies. The taste of the food is only 1 or 2 menus which are quite good. The others, in my opinion, are lacking. Bread toaster not working. Damaged Drink less 5. Inadequate facilities (Original) Kelebihan hotel yg pernah kita rasakan: 1. Bangunan hotel: Penampakan bangunannya bagus. Pertama lihat pasti berasa wow.. unik dan bagus ya.. pendapatku setelah menginap 2√ó, nih hotel benernya bagus, unik, homey. 2. Staf: Stafnya ramah, kita pernah minta tolong bersihkan kamarnya krn lantai berasa ngeres berdebu, ganti sprei/selimut, dilayani dgn baik dan tetap ramah. 3. Protokol di masa pandemi covid 19: Pertama menginap bbrp bulan lalu, begitu datang, kita disemprot desinfektan dan cek suhu badan. Tp yg kemaren ini nggak. di depan pintu lobby kemaren kebetulan ga ada staf. Mungkin krn sdh kemaleman. Waktu check in, lihat bolpoin untuk customer disinar lampu UV. 4. Kamar: Design interior kamar lumayan bagus, minimalis, begitu masuk berasa tenang. Lampunya kalem, jd masuk kamar berasa ambience ngantuk nya. Kebersihan secara keseluruhan lumayan. Kekurangan yg pernah kita alami: 1. Kamar: bagian lantai kamar berasa berdebu, gak ada lemari hanya rak gantungan baju. Sprei/selimut kadang pas dapet yg ada nodanya. Jd minta ganti. 2. Kamar mandi kamar: agak sempit dan agak kurang bersih di bagian lantai dan rak amenities. Kesannya seperti lawas. Di bagian lantai yg ada toilet duduknya, Tidak ada lubang saluran airnya. Jadi misal kena air semprotan jet shower toilet atau saat memakai wastafel, kebetulan ada air yg tumpah di lantai, airnya nyembeng di lantai, ga bisa turun ke lubang. Area shower oke lah. Showernya shower tanam di atas, plus kran. Waktu itu kok nggak ada keset + handuk ya? Jd minta ke petugasnya trus dikasih. Air angetnya waktu itu ga berfungsi. Lalu bilang ke resepsionis, akhirnya nyala. 3. Keset dan handuk waktu itu gak ada, minta dulu. 4. Breakfast: makan breakfast tempatnya ya di lantai lobby, meja cafe yg juga dibuka utk umum. Menunya ada lumayan macamnya, gak banyak, cuma pas kita mau makan, eh ternyata, semua menu kondisi sudah dingin, ga anget sama sekali. Padahal di bawahnya ada penghangat makanan pake spiritus. Tapi kondisi off. Jadi setelah ambil makanan, aku minta tolong petugasnya untuk hangatin makanan pake microwave. Semua makanan terbuka, dan ada bbrp lalat. Rasa makanan hanya 1 atau 2 menu yg lumayan enak. Yg lainnya menurutku kurang ya rasanya. Bread toaster gak berfungsi. Rusak Minumnya kurang 5. Fasilitas kurang memadai"

Mahima Hotel Semarang,Violita Angelina,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Located in the West Semarang area, this Mahima hotel is highly recommended. It has a karak that is relatively close to the Ahmad Yani international airport in Semarang. With a relatively affordable price, we can already get facilities that are more than just decent. An access card that allows only visitors who stay at the hotel to have access to the room by using an elevator or evacuation stairs. Security is very guaranteed, because not just anyone who is not a staying guest can access to the top floor. The breakfast menu is very varied, complete, and has a 5-star taste. Starting from rice with a choice of various side dishes, bread with a choice of various jams, various fruit juices, various cereals with milk, salad, pudding, fruit, and you can also request Ommellet. Worth to try. Parking is also adequate, quite spacious. The progress is very very good, every time a visitor enters, they will be directed to wash their hands or use a hand sanitizer, then self-check body temperature, then they will be fogged again with disinfectant by the security officer at the entrance. Every utensil, pens, tables and chairs in the restaurant, as well as all objects in the room are always sterilized and marked with sterilization. Highly recommended (Original) Terletak di daerah Semarang Barat, hotel Mahima ini sangat recommended. Memiliki karak yang tergolong dekat dari bandara internasional Ahmad Yani Semarang. Dengan harga yang relatif terjangkau, kita sudah bisa mendapatkan fasilitas yang lebih dari sekedar layak.

Keamanan sangat terjamin, karena tidak sembarang orang yang bukan tamu stay dapat akses naik ke lantai atas. Untuk menu breakfast sangat variatif, lengkap, dan rasa bintang 5. Mulai dari nasi dengan pilihan bermacam lauk, roti dengan pilihan bermacam selai, aneka jus buah, bermacam sereal dengan susu, salad, pudding, buah, dan juga bisa request Ommellet. Worthed to try. Parkir juga memadai, cukup luas. Prokes sangat sangat baik, setiap ada pengunjung masuk akan diarahkan cuci tangan atau memakai hand sanitizer, lalu self-check suhu badan, lalu akan di fogging lagi dengan desinfektan oleh petugas security di pintu masuk. Setiap peralatan, pulpen, meja dan kursi di resto, maupun seluruh benda di kamar selalu sudah di sterilisasi dan diberi tanda bahwa sudah disterilkan. Very recommended ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ"

The Azana Hotel Airport,Nadya Khoirunnisa,4.0,"Nice place and easy to access. The breakfast variety is good, but they are a bit slow in refill the food. Personally, what i like the most from this hotel is they serve all-day-long room service, so no matter what time it is, if you are hungry just grab the phone and call the room service. The room key is the one troubled me the most. I have to update it in the receptionist everytime i went out, because they say i put it too close to my phone (which is weird tho, because i dont put my phone in my bag). And they dont have minibar inside the room... a bit disappointing, but still okay...."

Hotel Tugu Indah,Ddm Destiny,1.0,"The actual place looks different from the photos. The location is quite far from city center. And there's no shop or food stall nearby. The room looks dull, old, and creepy with not so bright room lamp. Old and not clean bed. Old and not so clean toilet. The wastafel also clogged so its hard to even wash hand. Also there's no hot water in the room. There's small balcony in the opposite side of the room from front door. But the balcony only have a cement wall for its view and it creepy at night. I think this hotel supposedly only have below 2 star rank for this and many others negative comment. Not recommended for family trip"

Hotel Tugu Indah,Jekhda Nurhuda,4.0,"(Translated by Google) This is an old hotel from me still in school until now it is still active. The hotel is small enough with simple facilities. The lobby is less comfortable in my opinion with the couch for waiting to sit in the lobby. Entering the room smells a bit of AC when it is turned on, maybe because it is damp, long it doesn't fill. But the bed is still pretty good like most hotels. There is a terrace for relaxing but it's a shame how we want to sit back and relax on the ground because the grass isn't high and the terrace is dirty. The toilet is good, the towel must be able to replace the new one which is thick. Not the towel with the edges not in the seam. Conclusion is not comfortable in my opinion. (Original) Ini hotel lama dari saya masih sekolah sudah ada sampai sekarang masih aktif. Hotelnya kecil lumayanlah dengan fasilitas yang sederhana. Lobby kurang nyaman menurut saya dengan sofa buat menunggu duduk dilobby. Masuk ke kamar agak bau AC saat dinyalakan, mungkin karena lembab pengap lama ga di isi. Tapi kasurnya bed nya masih lumayan bagus spt hotel pada umumnya. Ada teras buat santai tapi sayang bagaimana kita mau duduk santai diteras karen rumput nya tinggi2 tidak dipotong dan teras kotor. Toiletnya lumayan handuknya harus dapat ganti yang baru yang tebal. Bukan handuk yang pinggirannya udah pada ga rapi jahitannya. Kesimpulan kurang nyaman menurut saya."

Hotel Tugu Indah,Dian Hendriyana,1.0,"(Translated by Google) Stayed in room 110 on the night of June 25, 2018 with my two nephews because of a long trip, we were guests with a B plate Jakarta vehicle. When checking out we wait well, and Ms. CS tells us that 1 Citato Snack has been eaten. I ask whether the two nieces eat? They answered no, even after I swore their oath for the sake of Allah ... I am sure my nephew was not eating because last night was full of my supervision. I was asked to pay 1 snack, then I gave 100 thousand money without change. And also my two nieces and nephews through this review swore again that we did not eat the illegitimate snack. Such illegitimate food is very inappropriate for us, because it will only make our prayers obstructed from God ... we are Muslim families who are devout worshipers, even our household rules are based on the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the Qur'an and Sunnah. We have surrendered to God whoever the staff of this hotel is to tyrannize us. God will surely repay his tyranny. Indeed, Allah is the God of the Just. It's not the nominal amount of money that we have a problem with ... because we have more than enough money, but the accusations are rash as if we are thieves ... that's what we don't accept. Tugu Indah Hotel staff has accused us of damaging our good name ... also hurt us. In the hereafter, I would like to be found with the hotel staff who have tyrannized us. Thank you.. (Original) Menginap di kamar 110 pada malam 25 Juni 2018 bersama kedua keponakan saya karena perjalanan jauh, kami tamu dengan kendaraan plat B Jakarta. Saat check out kami tunggu dg baik, dan mbak CS nya memberitahukan bahwa 1 Snack Citato telah dimakan. Saya tanya kpd kedua keponakan apakah makan? Mereka jawab tidak, bahkan setelah pun saya sumpah mereka demi Allah.. saya yakin keponakan sy tdk makan karena semalam penuh dalam pengawasan saya. Saya diminta bayar 1 Snack tersebut, lalu sy berikan uang 100rb tanpa kembalian. Dan saya juga kedua keponakan saya melalui review ini kembali bersumpah bahwa kami tidak makan Snack haram tersebut. Makanan haram tersebut sangat tidak layak bagi kami, karena hanya akan membuat doa kami terhalang dari Allah.. kami keluarga muslim yg taat beribadah, bahkan peraturan rumah tangga kami pun berlandaskan nilai-nilai Al-Qur'an dan Sunnah. Kami sudah serahkan kepada Allah siapapun staff hotel ini yang mendzalimi kami. Allah pasti akan balas kedzaliman nya. Sungguh Allah adalah Tuhan Yang Maha Adil. Bukan nominal uangnya yg kami permasalahkan.. karena kami memiliki bekal uang yg lebih dari cukup, namun tuduhan dengan terburu2 seolah kami pencuri.. itu yang kami tidak terima. Staff Hotel Tugu Indah telah menuduh, merusak nama baik kami.. juga melukai hati kami. Di akhirat kelak, saya ingin ditemukan dengan staff hotel yg telah mendzalimi kami tersebut. Terimakasih.."
Hotel Tugu Indah,Edi Purwanto,1.0,"(Translated by Google) The hotel staff accused us of eating citato, I'm afraid this is the mode ... because for my sake, my sister, and I don't have anyone to eat. Even though the staff finally apologized for admitting from a previous guest, still the hotel management was unprofessional and had slandered us ... tarnished our good name ... This hotel is not recommended by the staff, the mode alias hooked for illicit money. Hopefully our money is for paying for meat snacks in the hotel staff. Enjoy the illicit money from our profit. (Original) Staff hotel menuduh kami makan citato, sy khawatir ini modus.. karena demi Allah saya, saudari saya, dan om sy tdk ada yg makan. Walaupun akhirnya staff meminta maaf karena mengakui dari tamu sebelumnya, tetap saja manajemen hotel tdk profesional dan telah memfitnah kami.. mencoreng nama baik kami.. Hotel ini sngat tdk rekomendasi karen staff nya modus alias doyan uang haram. Semoga uang kami yg utk bayar snack mjd daging dlm tubuh staff hotel ini.

Front One Inn Hotel Semarang,Adil Prasetyo,1.0,"(Translated by Google) With a heavy heart I give 1 star. I stayed here because of an impromptu business trip. As soon as I entered the room I was greeted by the smell of a stuffy and unpleasant room. My eyes glanced to the right and I saw a pile of neatly folded towels but the color was dull. I took off my shoes while looking at the mattress, the white sheets looked old and unkempt and Omaigot!! There are faded brown spots like the former there was a thick liquid that was splashed and couldn't be removed when washed. I hastily checked the bathroom, it was true that the used wet toilet rolls were not replaced. The shower has crusty mud marks. The shower divider glass is full of dried water droplets. I immediately picked up the phone to call the cleaning service, it was denied that all the sheets were clean. After 15 minutes there was a knock on the bedroom door and it seemed that the person who came with new sheets was the same person who opened the door when I just arrived. (Original) Dengan berat hati saya kasih bintang 1. Saya menginap disini karena perjalanan dinas dadakan. Begitu masuk kamar saya disambut aroma kamar yang pengap dan tidak enak. Mata saya melirik ke kanan dan terlihat tumpukan handuk yang terlipat rapi namun warnanya kusam. Saya copot sepatu sembari memperhatikan kasur, sprei warna putih tampak tua dan tidak terawat dan Omaigot!! Ada bercak warna cokelat pudar seperti bekas ada cairan warna pekat yg terciprat dan tidak bisa hilang saat dicuci. Buru-buru saya cek kamar mandi, benar saja tisu gulung toilet bekas basah tidak diganti. Shower ada bekas lumpur yg berkerak. Kaca pembatas mandi penuh bekas titik air mengering. Langsung saya angkat gagang telepon menghubungi cleaning service, sempat dibantah kalau sprei bersih semua. Selang 15 menitan pintu kamar diketuk dan tampak orang yang datang membawa sprei baru adalah orang yang sama yang membukakan pintu saat saya baru datang."
Front One Inn Hotel Semarang,Emma Eryanti,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Pretty clean. But the floor tiles feel sticky. Maybe because the texture of the floor that resembles wood. The shower has a crust that causes the water to not drain completely. The rooms are cramped but okay for transit purposes. Not in the center of Semarang, but on the main road across the city. Friendly service. Fairly available parking. (Original) Lumayan bersih. Tapi keramik lantainya berasa lengket. Mungkin karena tekstur lantai yang menyerupai kayu. Showernya ada yang berkerak menyebabkan airnya tidak mengucur sepenuhnya. Kamarnya sempit tapi lumayan untuk yang bertujuan transit. Tidak di pusat kota Semarang, namun di jalan utama lintas kota. Pelayanan ramah. Parkir lumayan tersedia."
Front One Inn Hotel Semarang,Selly Christiani,4.0,"(Translated by Google) For low-budget hotels this is highly recommended. The room is clean only the WC part is a little dirty at the ends of the ceramic, the breakfast variance is low but with food that has a little taste, the taste is quite good, the parking lot is quite wide. The problem is that if you want to ask for 2 room keys, you must deposit a certain amount of money as a guarantee. The rest is OK. (Original) Untuk hotel low-budget ini sangat direkomendasikan. Kamar bersih hanya saja bagian WC agak sedikit kotor pada bagian ujung-ujung keramik, variansi sarapan rendah tapi dengan makanan yang sedikit citra rasa yang diberikan cukup enak, tempat parkir lumayan luas. Yang menjadi kendala adalah kalau mau minta 2 kunci kamar harus deposit sejumlah uang sebagai jaminan. Sisanya OK."
Hotel New Puri Garden Semarang,Wilson Fanjaya Jana,5.0,"Was looking for a pet friendly hotel in Semarang and lucky enough to find the right one. Spent a full month staying in this hotel with my dog and in overall, it met my expectations. New Puri Garden is a big old yet comfy hotel, with friendly staffs, spacious room & private garage, situated not far from Krapyak exit and driving distance to Marina Beach or Paragon Mall. It has a nice garden in front of each room, where you can bring your dog for morning/afternoon stroll. However, not all rooms are renovated and some areas need to be improved, especially the bathroom. But, as long as my four-legged is happy, that‚Äôs enough for me ‚ù§Ô∏è"
